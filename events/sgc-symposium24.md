## General information

The Swiss Geocomputing Centre (SGC) invites you to the symposium **Bridging Modelling and Data Sciences in the Geosciences**, taking place on **November 21-22, 2024** at the University of Lausanne.

The event will feature engaging talks and workshops on topics tackling reproducibility in the geoscientific domain, integrating geospatial data into ML/AI workflows, geocomputation for weather and climate modelling, applications in the insurance domain, and green IT, amongst others.

This symposium aims to provide a dynamic venue for showcasing research, fostering interdisciplinary dialogue, and building connections between academia, industry, and public sectors. We welcomes participants at all stages of their career and invite you to contribute in a poster session.

### Workshops - Thursday, 21 November 2024

#### Nvidia
TBA

:bulb: Participants interested in joining this workshop will be required to register for that in order to have access to the GPU compute resources for the workshop.

#### OSiRES
In this workshop we will demonstrate and discuss the needs and challenges regarding the utilization of geospatial webservices for reproducible research.

#### Ageospatial
Building the future of GeoForge: An interactive workshop on Generative AI usage in geospatial data assisted disaster management

**Details:** Participants will have the opportunity to test the GeoForge proof of concept. Ageospatial aims to gather valuable feedback and collaborate on ideas on how this future platform can provide real value in tackling current challenges, especially in disaster management and risk fields. We'll present use cases and invite participants to propose concrete improvements and suggest architectures for new AI frameworks such as Agentic AI systems, RAG concepts, and LangChain frameworks.

**Instructor:** Maaz Sheikh

## Registration

The symposium is completely free of charge. On site, you will be able to attend whichever conferences
you like, but for logistical reasons please indicate through the form which sessions you are interested in.

:memo: **Register here:** (Link available upon registration's opening)

## Posters

If you wish to present your past or ongoing research with a poster on Friday afternoon, please indicate so in the registration form. There are still many slots available for poster presentations. We encourage you to sign up and to re-use a poster you did present at a recent conference or event!

The poster session will be divided into two parts. First, each presenter will give a 2-minute presentation on a screen to introduce their research and provide context. For the remainder of the afternoon, attendees will be free to walk around, ask questions, and create network connections.
